# 💖 Portfolio For Our Relationship 📈

Welcome to **PFOR** — a data-driven love story.

This is a small web project created as a 2-year anniversary gift for my Edwinusha, to celebrate our journey together in the language he loves the most: **charts, values, and long-term investments** ❤️

## 🎁 About the Project

Our relationship has been a meaningful and ever-growing investment — filled with joyful highs, occasional dips, and beautiful milestones. This project visualizes those moments as a **line chart**, just like a portfolio of love.

Inspired by your passions — **investing and finance** — I built a personal web app that tracks the "market performance" of our relationship.

## 📊 Features

- 📅 **Date-aware timeline** — Every moment is tracked with its exact date and sorted chronologically.
- 📝 **Event logging** — Add sweet or not-so-sweet events with custom labels and love value changes.
- 🔁 **Live updating graph** — Watch our “love index” change over time.
- 💾 **Auto-saving** — Data is saved automatically to the browser with localStorage.
- ↩️ **Undo & Reset** — Fix mistakes or start fresh if needed.
- 📤 **CSV Export** — Download all your data at any time to save or share.

## 🧠 Technical Highlights

- Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**
- Powered by **Chart.js** for dynamic graphing
- Uses **localStorage** for persistent data without a server
- Fully self-contained — no installations or hosting needed

## 💡 How to Use

1. Open `love_portfolio_interactive.html` in any modern browser.
2. Add events by entering a date, description, and change in value.
3. The chart will update instantly and save your changes.
4. You can undo the last event, clear everything, or download your data as a CSV.

## 🎉 The Idea

To keep using this app together after our anniversary! Use it to reflect, celebrate progress, and keep tracking your emotional returns as your love continues to grow.

> This project is a celebration of **commitment and growth** — the best kind of investment 🥰
